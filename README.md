# granola-linux

`granola-linux` installs [Granola](https://www.granola.ai), the AI meeting
notepad, on a Linux desktop. Granola publishes builds for macOS and Windows
only. Its macOS disk image, however, is an Electron bundle: the app itself is
JavaScript, and the only parts tied to macOS are the Electron runtime it is
packed with and one native SQLite module. This script downloads that image
from Granola's own release endpoint, pairs the JavaScript with the Linux
Electron release of the same version, builds the SQLite module for Linux from
the sources in the image, applies a few small fixes, and installs the result
under your home directory with a desktop entry and a launcher.

This is an unofficial compatibility project. It is not affiliated with
Granola and it redistributes none of Granola's files: every install fetches
the image from Granola, and you sign in with your own account.

## Install

Requirements: x86-64 Linux, `curl`, `python3`, `node` and `npm`, `make`, and
`g++` 11 or newer. Reading the disk image needs 7-Zip 21.02 or newer (the
`7zip` package on Arch, Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 or later). Without one,
the script fetches the static build from 7-zip.org and checks it against a
checksum pinned in the script. The `p7zip` most distributions still ship
cannot read the image's compression.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cacarico/granola-linux
cd granola-linux
make install DRY_RUN=1   # prints what would happen, changes nothing
make install             # installs the current release
```

Start Granola from the application menu or with `~/.local/bin/granola`.
Sign-in opens in your browser and returns to the app through a `granola://`
link; the install registers the handler for it.

## Day to day

- `make status` shows the installed version and whether Granola has released
  a newer one.
- `make install` again updates. It stops early when the installed version is
  current; `./granola-linux install --force` rebuilds it anyway.
- `./granola-linux install --version 7.668.3` installs a specific release, and
  `--dmg FILE` builds from an image you already have.
- `make uninstall` removes the app and keeps your notes.
  `./granola-linux uninstall --purge` removes Granola's data too.

Everything is written as your user: the app under
`~/.local/share/granola-linux`, downloads under `~/.cache/granola-linux`, and
Granola's own data under `~/.config/Granola`, where the official app keeps it.
The `GRANOLA_LINUX_HOME`, `GRANOLA_LINUX_CACHE` and `GRANOLA_LINUX_BIN_DIR`
variables move the install root, the download cache and the launcher link.

## What to expect

Granola runs as the real app, not a development build: notes, sync, the AI
features, search and sign-in behave as they do on macOS, and the local
database is encrypted the same way. Microphone recording and transcription
work. The app runs natively on Wayland as well as X11, including the floating
meeting indicator, which on an unpatched build aborts the whole app under
Wayland.

Some things are different from the macOS build:

- Capture of the other side of a call. On macOS Granola taps system audio
  through Core Audio. The Linux runtime has no such path, so the launcher
  turns on Chromium's PipeWire capturer and the app records what the desktop
  portal offers it.
- Granola's auto-update is off. The installed version is pinned; `make
  status` tells you when a new release is out and `make install` brings it
  in.
- Features that call macOS frameworks directly, such as the Apple Calendar
  integration, do not exist on Linux. Google and Microsoft calendars are
  unaffected because they are handled on Granola's servers.
- System-wide keyboard shortcuts have not been tested here. Electron
  registers them through the window system, and Wayland compositors do not
  offer that to applications.

## Under the hood

Every step has a comment in the script that says what breaks without it,
so the conversion can be redone by hand from the comments alone. In outline:

**The image.** Granola's download page serves a small stub that fetches the
app at first launch on macOS, which is useless here. The script follows
Granola's release endpoint to the full image instead, and refuses the stub
with an explanation if one is passed with `--dmg`. The Electron version and
the app version are read from the image's property lists.

**The runtime.** The Linux build of that exact Electron version comes from
Electron's GitHub releases and is verified against the `SHASUMS256.txt`
published beside it. The app archive, its unpacked native modules and the
icons are copied from the image into the runtime; the macOS binaries stay
behind, since the app only loads them on macOS. The Electron binary is
renamed `granola`, because an Electron binary called `electron` reports the
app as unpackaged and Granola then runs with developer tooling and a "Not
packaged" tray menu.

**The SQLite module.** Granola uses a fork of `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`
with an `updateHook` method that no published build has. The fork's C++
source ships in the image; only `binding.gyp` is missing, and npm supplies it
from the release of the same version. The module is compiled against the
Electron headers for the installed runtime, with the newest `g++` of version
11 or later on the system.

**The patches.**

- The platform label. Granola's API returns an error for `platform=linux`,
  which blocks sign-in. The app's fallback for unknown platforms is rewritten
  to say `Windows`, with the same byte length, since the archive header
  records every file's offset. This is what the API sees, so Granola's own
  device list may show the install as Windows.
- The echo-cancellation notice. Granola cancels echo through Core Audio on
  macOS and treats every other platform as Windows, so the transcript view
  would say the feature is in beta on Windows. The notice stays, since it is
  true here as well, and names Linux instead.
- The click-and-drag module. The meeting indicator window is moved with a
  native module whose Linux build calls Xlib. Under Wayland that aborts the
  process. Its entry point is replaced with one that uses the native module on
  X11 and does nothing on Wayland.
- The tray icons. The macOS tray images are black template shapes that only
  macOS tints; on a dark Linux panel they are invisible. The coloured app icon
  takes their place.

**The safety net.** The rebuilt module and the drag stub are run inside the
installed Electron before anything is installed: the test opens an encrypted
database, checks that `updateHook` fires, and calls the stub under a Wayland
display. Only then is the new app swapped into place, so a failed build never
replaces a working one. If the system restricts unprivileged user namespaces,
which Chromium's sandbox needs, the script prints the root command that
enables the setuid sandbox helper rather than running anything as root.

## Safety and terms

The script is one file; read it before running it. It never runs as root. It
downloads from Granola's release host, Electron's GitHub releases,
electronjs.org, the npm registry and, when needed, 7-zip.org. Every download
except Granola's own image is checked against a published or pinned checksum;
Granola publishes none for its image.

Granola's terms of use forbid reverse engineering its software. This project
changes one string and one module's entry point in a copy you downloaded
yourself. Whether that is acceptable to you is your decision.

## Acknowledgements

Running the macOS bundle on the Linux Electron runtime, patching the platform
label and rebuilding the SQLite module from the sources in the image was
worked out and documented by
[tirtha4/Granola-for-Linux](https://github.com/tirtha4/Granola-for-Linux).
The stub-installer check, checksum verification of the Electron download,
the binary rename and the Wayland fix for the click-and-drag module were
first proposed in that repository's pull requests by regrog, jason-c-dev and
shawnyeager. This project is a fresh implementation of those ideas and shares
no code with them.
